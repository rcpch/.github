## Technical and Clinical Enquiries

### Discourse Forum

For all technical and clinical enquiries, we encourage the use of our open forum. This develops a community resource of previously asked and answered questions. These are the basis of an open, searchable knowledge base about the RCPCH platforms.

### RCPCH Community Signal Chat

We have an RCPCH Developers Signal chat group for instant message support of the RCPCH platforms.

We can't guarantee immediate response but our main developers see these messages and endeavour to respond as rapidly as possible. Join by using this link:
